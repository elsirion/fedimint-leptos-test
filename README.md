# Fedimint Client built with [Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos)

This repo contains a proof-of-concept of how to integrate `fedimint-client` with the Leptos web framework to build a
PWA. There are still some bugs being worked out, but there is a demo available at https://webimint.sirion.io/.

## Prerequisites

Check out [Fedimint](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint) at commit `183bff69f030b89f2cd78dbb91bdecf895048e3e`:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint
cd fedimint
git checkout 183bff69f030b89f2cd78dbb91bdecf895048e3e
```

Make sure you have [set up local dev environment](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/blob/master/docs/dev-env.md) needed to run `fedimint` locally

Open terminal and run to open development shell:

```shell
nix develop

just build
just mprocs
```

To get an invite code (you'll need it for next steps) select `user` process and enter `fedimint-cli dev invite-code`.

Example
```bash
bash-5.1$ fedimint-cli dev invite-code
{
  "invite_code": "fed1132h0j84q5t6qzg8vkxk2lj3dmmzw54flqh3m6z4yrf6ryyerrn6sg36nuratsuf0mjvm84svt40cuqq4waen5te0xyerwt3s9cczuvf6xyurzde59ld2c273s3xm3z3ms552g7x2yu0"
}
```

The invite code is needed in next step `Development`.


## Development

1. Open terminal and enter:

```shell 
nix develop

# only once
npm i

trunk serve
```

Your output will look like this:

```shell
